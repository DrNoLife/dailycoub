# dailycoub
Repo for the Twitter account [@CoubDaily](https://twitter.com/CoubDaily)

This program is used to upload a coub-a-day, to the previously mentioned Twitter profile.

# Notes
I guess you could say it's currently "done", but I am not satisfied with it. The reason being, is that it lacks a feature I really wanted to have included. <br/>
I wanted so the program would upload the short version of a coub, and then automaticly make a reply to that Tweet, with the long version of the same coub - this way, showing both versions.

However, due to the Python library I ended up using "TweePy", this ended in failure. It seems the library does not support the upload of "large" files to Twitter. If I am unable to find a solution to this, I might end up rewriting the program in C# instead (however, then I'd have learn a bit more stuff regarding media conversion etc. but it should be do-able).

Anyhow, I'm going to let it be as it is right now, but I will come back to it when I have the proper time for it.
